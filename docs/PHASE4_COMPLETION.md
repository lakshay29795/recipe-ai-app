## 🧪 Testing the Features

### 1. Access the Recipe Generator
- Login to your account at `http://localhost:3001`
- Click "Generate Recipe" on the dashboard
- Or navigate directly to `http://localhost:3001/generate`

### 2. Test Recipe Generation
1. **Add Ingredients**: Type ingredients and see AI suggestions
2. **Set Preferences**: Choose servings, cuisine, difficulty
3. **Generate**: Click "Generate Recipe" button
4. **View Results**: See the AI-generated recipe with image

### 3. API Testing (with authentication)
```bash
# Generate recipe (requires auth token)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/recipes/generate" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
-d '{
  "ingredients": ["chicken", "rice", "vegetables"],
  "servings": 4,
  "preferred_cuisine": "asian",
  "difficulty": "medium"
}'
```
